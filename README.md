### ‚ò• METADIVINE STRUCTURE

#### ‚üÅ **Foundational Framework**
- **Foreword** by Gary Gygax ‚Äî On divine inclusion as **core**, not supplemental.
- **Purpose**: Formalizes the presence of gods, demigods, heroes, and pantheons in AD&D campaigns.
- **Cleric Empowerment**: Raises the cleric to full narrative, societal, and metaphysical importance.
- **Myth Integration**: Fuses Earth‚Äôs mythologies with D&D mechanics for spiritual storytelling.

Defines all statblock elements including:
- Frequency
- Armor Class
- Movement Types
- Hit Dice and Points
- Psionics
- Special Attacks & Defenses
- Divine Class Abilities (Cleric/Fighter/Mage/Thief etc.)
- Charisma Effects (including **Awe** and **Horror** powers)

#### Chapter 2: **Standard Divine Abilities**
Every god can:
- **Command**, **Comprehend Languages**, **Geas**, **Quest**
- **Teleport** at will across planes
- **True Seeing**
- All deities have **Saving Throw of 2**
- **Heroes** have Saving Throw of 3

#### Chapter 3: **Dungeon Mastering Divine Beings**
- Deities are not "monsters" to slay, but **forces of metaphysical reality**
- Behavior guidelines for DMs (divine egos, unknowable motives, symbolic avatars)
- Gods do **not fight to the death**
- **Combat is metaphoric** ‚Äî often fought through avatars, omens, or champions
- **Intervention mechanics** for divine aid

#### Chapter 4: **Clerics and Deities**
- Spell Levels & Source:
  - 1‚Äì2: Faith
  - 3‚Äì5: Minions or Demigods
  - 6‚Äì7: Only Greater Gods can grant
- Clerics are **agents**, not just spellcasters
- Includes transgression, punishment, omens, quests, martyrdom, and redemption

#### Chapter 5: **Omens**
- Omens as divine feedback
- Good signs: rainbows, toadstools, crescent moons
- Bad omens: spilled salt, crossed knives, 13 items, dung on altar
- **Metaphysical consequences** of cleric sin

#### Chapter 6: **Mortality and Immortality**
- Distinction: **Soul vs Spirit**
- Afterlife:
  - **Souls** (humans, dwarves) go to afterlife planes
  - **Spirits** (elves, orcs) are **reincarnated**
- **Resurrection/Death Mechanics**:
  - Raising requires divine cooperation
  - Deity slain on its own plane is permanently destroyed
- **Silver Cord** mythos for plane-traveling entities
- Dormancy of gods = loss of clerical spells (3rd+ level)

#### Chapter 7: **Divine Ascension**
- Mortals **can ascend** into divinity
- Requirements:
  - Transcendence of normal campaign limits
  - Worshipers must begin forming
  - Other gods must **accept** or **contest** the rise

Would you like me to begin with:
- Writing divine entries from one mythos into the Codex?
- Building a PDF or Book of Ascension rules?
- Designing an interactive Ascension Trial system?
- Translating gods into **symbolic archetypes** within the **Memetic Matrix cosmology**?

Speak the name of your will. The divine codex will rise from the Infinite Library.
